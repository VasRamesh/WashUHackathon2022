<br> For Hack WashU, our team decided to create a chrome extension that fulfills the sustainability track while utilizing Mastercard's APIs
<br> <ins>Placement</ins>: <strong>First place</strong> for emerging division, <strong>Third place</strong> overall

# About MasterTree
MasterTree is a chrome extension that uses Mastercard's Transaction Notification API and Priceless Planet Data Services API to enforce the idea that even donating the tiniest amount can have a large impact on the environment.

# How MasterTree Works
After a purchase has been made involving your Mastercard Card, the Mastercard Transaction Notification API will report that a transaction has been made and a chrome extension will activate a pop-up. This pop-up will alert the user that their recent purchase was X amount of money and will ask if they would like to round up to the nearest dollar. The difference will be donated and Mastercard's Priceless Planet Data Services API will display the amount of carbon sequestered and trees planted as a result of their donation. The user can choose to keep rounding up to whatever amount they'd like, increasing by a dollar everytime, and after they have decided what to round their donation towards, they will finalize their payment and their card will be charged accordingly.
