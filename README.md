# WashUHackathon2022
Team: Eric You, Vas Ramesh, Sanketh Gudapati, and Noah Li
<br> For Hack WashU, our team decided to tackle the sustainability route through the use of Mastercard's APIs: 
- manifest.json: holds all the information for constructing the google chrome extension
- images folder: contains the 16x16,48x48,&128x128px logos for the google chrome extension
- popup.html: main html file that is called from manifest.json. Front-end development for the popup (design)
- style.css: css file accompanying popup.html
- function.js: js file that performs calculations and back-end functionality of popup based on API information
