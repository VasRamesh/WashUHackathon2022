<strong>Team</strong>: Eric You, Vas Ramesh, Sanketh Gudapati, and Noah Li
<br> For Hack WashU, our team decided to create a chrome extension that fulfills the sustainability track while utilizing Mastercard's APIs
<br> <strong>Placement</strong>: First place for emerging category and Third Place overall

# About MasterTree
MasterTree is a chrome extension that uses Mastercard's Transaction Notification API and Priceless Planet Data Services API to enforce the idea that even donating the tiniest amount can have a large impact on the environment.

# How MasterTree Works

- manifest.json: holds all the information for constructing the google chrome extension
- images folder: contains the 16x16,48x48,&128x128px logos for the google chrome extension
- popup.html: main html file that is called from manifest.json. Front-end development for the popup (design)
- style.css: css file accompanying popup.html
- function.js: js file that performs calculations and back-end functionality of popup based on API information
